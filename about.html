						My name is Adrian Shikwambana from a small town called Phalaborwa, Limpopo.
						I am popular known as Floyd.
						I am a varsity graduate from North West University Mafikeng Campus. I graduated in 2017 and hold a Bcom Information Systems Degree.

					<p class="dark">
						I am indoor person. I love coding and everything about technology. I am an avid game lover especially action, racing, and soccer games.
					</p>
					
					<p class="lighter">
						After my varsity, I got an internship at ProServ partnered with Oracle. I was a IT Consultant for the duration of 12 months.
						I enjoyed my 1st time work experience and after 12 month the internship ended successfully.
						I later got a learnership from Dynamic DNA as a C# Developer which was for 6 months, I utterly enjoyed the learnership as i was hands on with something that i love which is coding.
						After the learnerhsip at Dynamic DNA ended, I hustled for employment and finally got answered at Standard Bank with a Data Engineering learnership, which is what im busy with at the moment. I am liking the experience so far and its keeping me intrigued.
